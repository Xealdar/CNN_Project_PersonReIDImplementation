To install cuda, I installed cuda 10.2 with nvidia guide installation and
cudnn too.

Then I compiled pytorch from source thanks to pytorch documentation.

I began to use docker to install torchvision, but finally it didn't work well
so I used torchvision from pip install torchvision, and I downgraded pillow 
version : pip install "pillow<7" after uninstalling it after it has 
been install by pip install torchvision.

environment : Person_reID_baseline_pytorch_env
